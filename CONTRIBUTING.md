# Constributing to SJTUBeamermin

SJTUBeamermin is now at 0.9-beta-LTS. Since it is final exam week in SJTU, the author himself won't have more time on this template until July 1st. And it is a good time for you to show your talent through TeXing! ðŸ¥°

Long Term Support (LTS) hallmark means there will be no significant change on the template in a period. Furthermore, **No Issues before July 1st will be Processed.** Noticing that there could be no more contributor to answer your issue, the author writes down a developer's guide on this template.

**[DEVELOPER'S GUIDE ON SJTUBEAMERMIN](doc/SJTUBeamermindevguide.pdf)**

This guide will tell you how the template is composed. If you meet some problems with the internal mechanism, you could refer to this guide for performing debugging actions. When getting familiar with this whole project, try to modify some definitions of the components or create your features by **forking this repo**. After implementing your great TeX code, **Pull Request** your repo back to this upstream to benefit more users. Reasonable contributions will be accepted into the next version of SJTUBeamermin.
